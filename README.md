A Medium like social blogging platform that allows authors to post realtime content that is search engine optimized and bot-friendly. The application features server side rendering standards like SSR and ISR through Next.js, Firestore data modeling, user authentication, custom usernames, hearts and image file uploads. Deployment is done using Vercel and fully protected with security rules specified in Firebase.

## ðŸ’» Tech 
The React in the front end directly connects with Firebase backend services, removing the need for a middle API. User auth is handled by Firebase using OAuth 2.0 and Google sign in.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
